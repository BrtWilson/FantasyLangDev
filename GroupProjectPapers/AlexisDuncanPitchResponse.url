  Hi, I'm Alexis Duncan and I’m interested in joining this project. I'm interesed in joining this project because I have, for years, wanted to have something like this. I liked making
languages when I was younger, but I’m not a linguist and nor do I ever plan on being one. I’d use this for Dungeons and Dragons for sure, if it existed, so why not help make it a thing?
  I am a UI/UX emphasis, so if this project needs a front end I can help make that and work to get it connected to the back end. If it doesn’t need one or my skills with the front end
aren’t needed I can definitely help with back end code. I’ve gone through enough schooling to help with that. I can’t really help with the linguistics part though.
  I am unsure of the Business and Legal side of this project. I am sure the Operations will be very simple, such as a text input, and the Technical would likely be over a website or
app I assume.  Social wise, this would help with world building that could go into stories or RPGs for sure.
